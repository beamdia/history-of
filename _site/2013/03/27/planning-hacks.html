<h2>PlanningHacks</h2>
<p>We start hosting evening hacknights in the penthouse, attracting a crowd of developers, tech-minded planners, and community activists. These continue today, as part of the activities of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/betanyc/">BetaNYC</a>. In 2014, we help tee up the <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2013/06/citibike-data-night-june-26th/">first round of Citi Bike hacknights</a>.</p>
