Clocking up over 10,000 suggestions and spawning serveral interesting analysis and a tumblr blog called fuckyeahbikeshare http://fuckyeahbikeshare.tumblr.com/page/5</p>

<p>Shareabouts as a configurable project launches in November, built on Rails. Later we rebuild with a Django architecture, and a loosely-coupled front and back end. We go on to replicate this type of Shareabouts map in other cities, helping planners collect input from tens of thousands of people. </p>
