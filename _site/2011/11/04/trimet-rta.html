<h2>Lots of OpenTripPlanner</h2>
<p>2011 was a big year for <a href="http://www.opentripplanner.org/">OpenTripPlanner</a>. In July, we headed to Portland for a <a href="https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/2011-OTP-Workshop">two-year follow-up workshop</a>. In Setember, Kevin and David presented at GIS in Transit. And in October, TriMet launched their <a href="http://trimet.org/news/releases/oct15-rtp.htm">OTP-powered Regional Trip Planner</a>.</p>
