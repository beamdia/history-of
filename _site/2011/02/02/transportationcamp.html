<h2>TransportationCamp East and West</h2>
<p>We convened thinkers and doers for two high-energy explorations of the exciting world of transportation and tech. In March we took over the New York Law School building, for two packed unconference days peppered with lunchtime and evening talks from local and national transportation leadership. A few weeks later, we headed west to a nightclub for a San Francisco version - again with some great talks to kick us off, and dozens of top unconference sessions. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/transportationcamp/">Lots of pics here</a>.</p>

<p>The event format was modeled on TransparencyCamp and CityCamp, putting attendees into the driving seat of planning and leading sessions. Unlike other planning and transportation conferences, TranspoCamp was accessible, informal and a lot of fun. But also very productive, with deep sessions and corridor conversations leading to new collaborations and re-energized participants inside and outside gov. The East and West camps were produced with support from Rockefeller Foundation and <a href="http://transportationcamp.org/events/east/">others</a>. Today, TransportationCamps have multiple sponsors and organizers, and have taken place in New England, DC, SF and Atlanta, with <a href="http://transportationcamp.org">more in the pipeline</a>. See you at the next one!</p>
