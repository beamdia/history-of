<p>Together with the <a href="http://www.bikewalkalliance.org/">Alliance for Biking and Walking</a> and <a href="http://www.streetplans.org/">Street Plans Collaborative</a>, we built the <a href="http://openstreetsproject.org/">Open Streets Project</a>, a crowdsourced directory of “open streets” events. Also known as ciclovias, where cities close streets to vehicles and open up for cycling and walking and fun. </p>

<p>The project website showcases dozens of current initiatives, and allows municipalities and advocacy organizations to share information and resources on their open streets initiatives as they evolve and expand. <a href="http://openstreetsproject.org/">Check it out</a>, and <a href="http://www.streetplans.org/research_and_writing.php">read The Open Streets Guide</a> for tips on starting an event in your community.</p>
