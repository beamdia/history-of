<h2>Down with T.O.P.P.</h2>
<p>In February, Nick writes that “<a href="http://www.nickgrossman.is/2010/02/18/topp-labs-needs-a-new-name/">TOPP Labs needs a new name</a>”, and offers a t-shirt for the best suggestion. </p>

<p>The hive mind proposals include Center for Civic Coherence, Office of Municipal Innovation, and Super Awesome Group. The winning suggestion, Civic Works, comes from Frank Hebbert*. No more TOPP. Andy designs a new logo, and we have the best business cards.</p>

<p>Finding a descriptive name for the software team inside the bigger organization was a recurring problem. Back in 2008, Nick emailed some thoughts to the team. <em>We’re still trying to come up with a better/more accurate/less confusing/less boring name for our group.  “Software &amp; Design” is cumbersome and not terribly informative, and “non-Geo TOPP” just doesn’t feel right ;).  I suppose criteria for a new name are that it should be clear &amp; concise and should disambiguate us from TOPP The Organization.</em>.</p>

<p><small>* I never got the t-shirt</small></p>
