<h2>MTA data</h2>
<p>Thanks to advocacy from TOPP and others, the MTA’s position on developer access to data is transformed. </p>

<p>“We need to get out of our own way and instead get out in front of the data sharing revolution,” MTA Chair Jay Walder said in a statement. “By making access to our data directly from our website, we are encouraging the developer community to do the work we can’t to create apps that benefit our customers at no cost to the MTA.” <a href="http://www.streetsblog.org/2010/01/13/mta-unveils-open-data-policy-clearing-a-path-for-nyc-transit-apps/">Read all about it in Streetsblog</a>! </p>

<p>Later in the year, there’s more data and the first MTA developer conference.</p>
