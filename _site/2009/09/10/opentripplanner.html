<h2></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.opentripplanner.org/">OpenTripPlanner</a> is an open source, multi-modal trip planner, with major involvement and leadership from OpenPlans. It’s collaboratively developed by a team of developers from across the world, as as free software, any agency or researcher (or anyone!) is welcome to use and improve it.</p>

<p>OTP is probably the most succesful open project from OpenPlans, in terms of the number of contributors – developers working on OpenTripPlanner hail from all over the world, initially combining teams from TriMet, OpenPlans, Graphserver, FivePoints, byCycle, and OneBusAway, among others. The <a href="https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/kick-off-workshop">July 2009 kickoff</a> for the project was a transit workshop in Portland hosted by TriMet, the regional transportation authority (who later launched their <a href="https://ride.trimet.org/">OTP-powered trip planner</a> in 2011).</p>
