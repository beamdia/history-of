<h2>Transparency Camp</h2>
<p>Nick and Phil attend TransparencyCamp ’09. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nickgrossman.is/2009/03/04/getting-my-transparency-on/">Nick reported back to the team</a>: <em>Tech people love twitter</em> and <em>Open Government and Transparency are a really big deal</em>. </p>

<p>And: <em>Government transparency and civic engagement go hand in hand. One line I overheard that I really liked was: “a ‘push’ government can encourage relevant contributions from citizens by providing relevant data.”  I think there’s something really powerful in that, and somewhere in there is a core idea for TOPP and TOPP Labs.  If we are interested in encouraging citizen participation and empowering individuals, the opening up of government data will be a core component.  It’s my theory that there’s a huge latent demand for participation, but that people just don’t know how or don’t have the right ways to engage.  The proliferation of civic data that’s on the way should provide ample seed for interesting citizen engagement projects.</em></p>
