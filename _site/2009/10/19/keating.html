<p>Michael Keating joins to work on business development for the transportation team. He later founds <a href="http://www.scootnetworks.com/">Scoot</a> in SF (where, in 2014, they use a Shareabouts map to collect location suggestions!)</p>

<p>In 2010 he took a trip to Europe. “We were not in Soho anymore. There was no pizza, no sticker-covered Macs, and most strikingly, no day jobs. Everyone in the room actually worked in the field of transit information systems, specifically on the design of user interfaces for real time trip planning. The room was packed. The clothes were black. Designer eyeglasses and shaved heads were in abundance. This could have been an architecture firm, or seeing as we were in central Europe, an episode of Sprockets. The International Institute for Information Design’s 5th Annual Expert Forum on Traffic and Transport was no open transit data meet-up.” <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2010/10/now-is-the-time-on-transit-when-we-dance/">Now is the time on transit where we dance!</a></p>
