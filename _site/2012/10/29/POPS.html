<p>The goal of the site is to publicize this little-known public resource for NYC residents and visitors and to serve as a resource for urban-planning enthusiasts. People can find out information about the various POPS, can rate, comment, post photos, post announcements about a POPS and can also voice complaints when a particular POPS isnâ€™t meeting regulations.</p>
