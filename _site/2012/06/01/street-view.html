<h2>Public commenting with Street View</h2>
<p>To <a href="http://a841-tfpweb.nyc.gov/4thave/what-needs-improving-on-4th-ave-in-bay-ridge/">gather feedback along 4th Avenue in Brooklyn</a>, New York invites residents to leave comments using Google Street View. </p>

<p>With a plugin we create for NYC DOT’s Wordpress site, visitors pin hundreds comments to particular views at each intersection. The interface includes a neat slider, making it easy and fun to slide down the street and view each location. We return to Street View in 2014, for DOT’s Vision Zero map.</p>
