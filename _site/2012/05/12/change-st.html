<h2>Take a walk down Change Street</h2>
<p>A ‘20% time’ project, we create a cartoon wiki to guide local advocacy. A fun project, but addressing a serious challenge – it’s not easy to know which city agency, department, or program handles even basic street issues like trees, bike parking, sidewallk repairs, drains, etc…</p>

<blockquote>Enter Change St, a super-simple cartoon streetscape. Scroll down, and your cheerful digital avatar takes a walk, past street trees, bike racks, a speed bump, and a block party. For each one, hover your cursor to see a few useful links about each improvement, including where to get started. With this project, we’re experimenting with unconventional ways to display useful info.

change.st is also a development experiment – we’re taking advantage of modern browsers’ recent adoption of Scalable Vector Graphics to render highly interactive scenes.  Fast Javascript engines make it possible to project from 3-dimensional space to the screen in the browser on the fly. We’re creating and positioning scene elements on the fly – as you scroll down the page, each item in the scene gets repositioned in 3D space relative to the world around it, and projected into 2D.  We then use jQuery to place the items where they should be on screen.</blockquote>
