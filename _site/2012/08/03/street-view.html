<h2>Public commenting with Street View</h2>
<p>To gather feedback along 4th Avenue in Brooklyn, DOT invites comments via Street View. Using a plugin we create for their wordpress site, visitors can “pin” comments to particular views at each intersection. This is the genesis for the Vision Zero site we build in 2014. The  UI is a neat slider, making it easy to slide down the street and view each location. http://cjyabraham.com/files/2012/08/ss.png http://cjyabraham.com/files/2012/08/4th.png http://blog.openplans.org/2013/01/fitzgerald-in-the-field/</p>
