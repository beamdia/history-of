<p>June 30th - Ian Bicking joins “I’ll soon be starting a new job with a non-profit organization, The Open Planning Project. I’m still trying to get a handle on the exact goals of the project, as the history of TOPP has involved several subprojects, and the project I’m working on is both complementary to the other projects (which are primarily about participatory urban planning) and also a new direction. The short form of the mission seems best described as creating a Sourceforge for community organizing, which covers a lot and seems to be pretty accurate. I haven’t yet figured out how to concisely explain it to friends and family members who aren’t programmers.” http://www.ianbicking.org/new-job-open-plans.html</p>
