<p>Shareabouts works great for collaborative data collection, but could you use it to make a more personal map? We explore this idea with Stomping Ground, a fun drag-and-drop sticky dot interface for mapping places you like walking. Each map can be re-visited later, and others can comment on it. Interface ideas tried out in Stomping Ground later end up in the core Shareabouts client.</p>
