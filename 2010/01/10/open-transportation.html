<p>“Civic Works is the group within OpenPlans setting out to accomplish the goal of open source for open government.  The long-term goal is to build &amp; support a set of tools that comprise the ‘Open City Stack’ and the ‘Open City API’ – the fundamental tools that governments need to run efficiently and effectively, towards the goals of transparency, participation, and collaboration.  Over time, Civic Works should support software across a variety of civic verticals – from transportation &amp; planning to education, healthcare, social services, finance, etc.”</p>
