<p>Jeff joined to head up Bus Time and other open transportation projects, later as co-director of the Transportation group. Now at <a href="http://www.controlgroup.com/">Control Group</a>.</p>

<p>As well as delivering the most impactful civic tech project ever (an on time, on budget, open source city-wide  tracker for the busiest bus system in the US), Jeff brought <a href="http://www.codeforamerica.org/blog/2013/02/11/future-civic-technology-a-talk-with-jeff-maki/">deep thinking</a>, organizational rigor, and internal systems, including the 2012 OpenPlans Code: <em>Do What’s Expected (except when coming up with new ideas); “Let’s Talk” (if you see something, say something); This is real life (the great responsibility of helping our clients through their problems); Be Present (even when you’re remote); Keep It Simple (half, not half-assed); Be Public (“make things public”); Act As-If (fake-pretend).</em> Plus, some memorable quotes (e.g. <a href="https://youtu.be/AO_t7GtXO6w?t=26s">“Always Be Closing”</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy-Y3HJNU_s">“there’s no words on it!”</a>).</p>
