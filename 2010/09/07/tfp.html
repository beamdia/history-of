<h2>Transportation Feedback Portals for NYC</h2>
<p>For NYCDOT, we created “Transportation Feedback Portals”  – a Wordpress template configured for presenting the latest with neighborhood transportation projects. The sites were build out to meet the needs to staff at the agency, and tested with residents and stakeholders in the first study area, in Jackson Heights. The template presented all documents and news associated with a project, as well as presenting each proposal with annotations for comments, and the traffic data behind a project in an interactive map for easy exploration.</p>

<p>Later portals included a parking study in Manhattan’s Chinatown, the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway, Fourth Avene in Brooklyn, and the crowdsourcing map for bikeshare. </p>
