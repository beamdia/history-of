Make Brooklyn Safer is a community group working for safer streets in Brooklyn. To help them identify intersections where families don't feel safe crossing the street, we set up a Shareabouts map. After collecting hundreds of locations in several neighborhoods, Hilda Cohen and her team create simple paper maps of the results (<a href="images/2014/02/speeding.pdf">like this</a>), and use these in meetings at the local police precincts. The online map makes for easy data collection, but for impact, having a paper map to show is best. We later hear that NYPD officers also refer to the online maps directly, to check on reported locations where more enforcement might be needed.
