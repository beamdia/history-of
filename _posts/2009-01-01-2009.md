Early in 2009, Mike Lydon writes about TOPP and our advocacy journalism stable-mates: "At the center of the city's livable streets movement is a little known non-profit comprised of Gen X and Y tech geeks, educators, artists, and journalist-urban activists who leverage open web technology to network catalytic change in the 21st century city." http://www.planetizen.com/node/37154

(Mike later snags a desk from us in the penthouse, which shows that you can't go wrong writing flattering articles)
