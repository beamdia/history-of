Here we are, setting up five community maps on Shareabouts Day to celebrate how easy it is to configure Shareabouts. After a competitive bidding process, the winning projects are: 

* a map of bike parking at commuter rail in Philly
* mapping the good and not so good in a Queens neighborhood
* identifying historic properties in Louisville KY
* sharing stories of unsafe streets in Brooklyn
* tracking social interactions around social workspaces in Cambridge MA
