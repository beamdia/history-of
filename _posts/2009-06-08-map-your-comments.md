Our long-standing interest in collecting comments on maps continues, with a Wordpress plugin to add locations to blog comments. Used by Gotham Schools.

Chris <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2009/06/map-your-comments/">blogs about it</a>: <em>The post format is good for time-sensitive topics like mapping participation at a city-wide event and puts a map at the top of the regular list of comments. The page format is good for more permanent topics like mapping dangerous NYC intersections and fills the whole page with a large map beside a column of comments. People can then leave comments and location information which are geo-coded and become points on the map.</em>
