In February, Nick writes that "<a href="http://www.nickgrossman.is/2010/02/18/topp-labs-needs-a-new-name/">TOPP Labs needs a new name</a>", and offers a t-shirt for the best suggestion. 

The hive mind proposals include Center for Civic Coherence, Office of Municipal Innovation, and Super Awesome Group. The winning suggestion, Civic Works, comes from Frank Hebbert&#42;. No more TOPP. Andy designs a new logo, and we have the best business cards.

Finding a descriptive name for the software team inside the bigger organization was a recurring problem. Back in 2008, Nick emailed some thoughts to the team. *We're still trying to come up with a better/more accurate/less confusing/less boring name for our group.  "Software & Design" is cumbersome and not terribly informative, and "non-Geo TOPP" just doesn't feel right ;).  I suppose criteria for a new name are that it should be clear & concise and should disambiguate us from TOPP The Organization.*.
