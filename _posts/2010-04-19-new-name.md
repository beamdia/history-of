No more TOPP, we're now OpenPlans. Andy designs a new logo, and we have the best business cards.

February 18th -- Nick writes a blog post, "TOPP Labs needs a new name".  http://www.nickgrossman.is/2010/02/18/topp-labs-needs-a-new-name/. Nick asks for naming ideas, and offers a t-shirt for the best one. Suggestions from the hive mind include Center for Civic Coherence, Office of Municipal Innovation, and Super Awesome Group. The winning suggestion, Civic Works, comes from a guy called Frank Hebbert. He never got the t shirt.

"We're still trying to come up with a better/more accurate/less confusing/less boring name for our group.  "Software & Design" is cumbersome and not terribly informative, and "non-Geo TOPP" just doesn't feel right ;).  I suppose criteria for a new name are that it should be clear & concise and should disambiguate us from TOPP The Organization." - Nick in 2008.
