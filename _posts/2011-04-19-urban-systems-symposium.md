Two days of discussion around the future of cities and tech at the first Urban System Symposium. We help organize the event, bringing together various "smart city" folks, from the likes of IBM, with advocates, planners, and forward-thinking city staff. After this and the annual American Planning Association conference, we say "planning needs more unconferences" -- and only 3 years later, we organize PlanningCamp.
