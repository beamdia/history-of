Seen here at 2011's TransportationCamp, NYC Council Member Gale Brewer <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2009/09/ny-city-council-member-calls-for-open-transit-data/">was in the vanguard of our campaign to open up transit data</a> -- "Opening transit data would require almost no capital investment by the MTA, while the application developers would return innovative tools of immense everyday value to the public at minimal expense." Later Manhattan Borough President, Gale continues to be a huge supporter of open data, including the very important Open Data Law passed in 2011.
