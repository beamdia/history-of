2012 was a great year for the organization. The small Civic Works team entered a two-year sprint of building open tools that got used and re-used (something that remains elusive in the civic and planning tech worlds). Our Transportation team wrapped up Bus Time, and Conveyal became a separate company working on OpenTripPlanner.

"I am really impressed by and proud of the work that OpenPlans has been doing lately.  They are on fire pumping out small, but beautiful, compelling and powerful apps."
