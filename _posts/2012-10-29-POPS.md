We help MAS get a <a href="http://apops.mas.org/">website</a> up and running for advocacy around Privately Owned Public Space. The site publicizes these little-known public resource for NYC residents and visitors, and serves as a resource for urban-planning enthusiasts. People can find out information about the various POPS, can rate, comment, post photos, post announcements about a POPS and can also voice complaints when a particular POPS may not be meeting regulations.
