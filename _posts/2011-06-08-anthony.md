Artisan bus cartographer Anthony Denaro joins, making the office and blog more colorful and fun (e.g. <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2011/10/generation-x/">quoting Douglas Copeland</a>, "And yet in spite of the cityâ€™s madness Edward noticed that its inhabitants moved about with ease, unconcerned that around any corner there might lurk a clown tossed marshmallow cream pie, a Brigada Rosa kneecapping or a kiss from the lovely film star Sophia Loren. And directions were impossible.  When he asked an inhabitant where he could buy a map, the inhabitant looked at Edward as though he were mad, then ran away screaming."). 

He's now keeping the <a href="http://samsungaccelerator.com/">Samsung Accelerator</a> cool.
