2009 was a breakthrough year for open transit data in NYC. We did our share of pushing the wheel, both through advocacy and direct tech work. What started as an antagonistic relationship between developers and the agency became something much more useful, leading to a great range of apps and analytical tools, and several years later, the still-running MTA App Quest. 

But that was all in the future. In April, David Turner FOILed for MTA NYCT bus routes. "Google Transit has the MTA’s bus timing data so that they can do trip planning. But the MTA for some reason won’t let them release it. I filed a FOIL request with the MTA for that data." Around the same time, Anil scraped the MTA's budget out of PDFs and into a machine readable format.
