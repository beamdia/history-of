<a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2009/08/new-york-public-transit-data-summit-with-beer-2/">Wrote Nick B-S</a>: 

*The MTA is understandably concerned about inaccurate or out of date data giving them a bad name. They don’t want riders getting bad data and then blaming them for it, and neither do we. And the MTA doesn’t want to spend all their time responding to FOIL requests. It’s in nobody’s interest to make the MTA’s already tough job harder; as taxpayers, we want to help the MTA be as efficient as possible. As New Yorkers, we want the city to stay on the cutting edge of public transportation.*

*We think these problems are solvable. That’s why we propose a meeting of the minds. We think progress is made when people come together, honestly discuss their goals, and work cooperatively to reach mutually beneficial solutions.*

*And that’s why we’re hosting a New York Transporation Data Summit. With beer. While the event will be open to the public, we’ve specifically reached out to MTA employees, open government advocates, application developers, and transit enthusiasts.*

Two dozen transit advocates, mobile and web developers, urban planners, lawyers, and open government supporters discussed the current climate for developing transit applications, its shortcomings, and how the community can work with the MTA to improve things. Later in the year, we launched NYTransitData.org to make the case for opening up data. Transit developer drinks and pizza continued for some years.
