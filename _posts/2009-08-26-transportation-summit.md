"From Nick B-S's blog post -- We had a room packed with passionate and thoughtful people eager to help make public transit in New York more efficient, accessible, and and easy to use.

For more than two hours, the group — comprised of over two dozen transit advocates, mobile and web developers, urban planners, lawyers, and open government supporters — discussed the current climate for developing transit applications, its shortcomings, and how the community can work with the MTA to improve things. http://blog.openplans.org/2009/08/better-data-better-apps-better-transportation-2/"

September -- NYTransitData.org launches, leads to open data and a dev conference later.
