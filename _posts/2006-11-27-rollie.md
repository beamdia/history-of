Rollie joins to work on OpenGeo projects. Now at <a href="http://boundlessgeo.com/">Boundless</a>.

From <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2009/04/great-responsibility/">a blog post about the potential unintended consequences of civic tech</a>: "As we move towards encouraging open government and increased transparency, I wonder if we're not being sufficiently critical about the tools we are building. Just as free access to government data enables us to build tools to encourage progressive change, it also enables others to cripple the machinery of government or hijack them towards ends we cannot foresee and wouldn't necessarily support. Tools like Uncivil Servants, which allow progressive transportation advocates to underscore parking permit abuse and push for reform could just as easily be reconfigured to highlight the abuses of cyclists and push for policy changes with which progressives would disagree."
