"OpenPlans Transportation, in partnership with Cambridge Systematics, is excited to announce that we have been selected to implement MTA Bus Time (real-time bus tracking) on all of Staten Island’s local and express bus routes by 2012! Bus Time will be expanded to all of New York City shortly thereafter, eventually covering the MTA’s 6000 local and express buses, serving millions of riders each day.  Real-time bus arrival information for all local and express routes will be available via SMS, by scanning QR-codes, and via mobile & desktop web browsers. The days of knowing exactly where your bus is are fast approaching." http://blog.openplans.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bus_Time_Boys-1024x1024.jpg
