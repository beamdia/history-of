 -- including diagrams and Nick's strategy text - -Civic Works is the group within OpenPlans setting out to accomplish the goal of open source for open government.  The long-term goal is to build & support a set of tools that comprise the "Open City Stack" and the "Open City API" -- the fundamental tools that governments need to run efficiently and effectively, towards the goals of transparency, participation, and collaboration.  Over time, Civic Works should support software across a variety of civic verticals -- from transportation & planning to education, healthcare, social services, finance, etc.
