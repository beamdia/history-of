In October, Sandy hits NYC hard, devastating low-lying neighborhoods. 44 people die. Power is out below 14th St for several days.

In the aftermath, the MTA closes tunnels because of flooding. We use new features in OpenTripPlanner Analyst to <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2012/10/visualizing-transit-accessibility-minute-by-minute/">show the difference in transit accessibility</a> before and after the storm. 

Later, we work with NY Rising in six neighborhoods, providing collaborative maps for residents to "fact-check" basemaps used for planning future responses. Is the map missing a day care facility or a building with seniors? No problem - add it to the map.
