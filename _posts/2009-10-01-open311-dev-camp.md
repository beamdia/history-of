We convened a DevCamp at our fancy new office, to discuss and develop what's needed to make Open311 services more accessible and for cities to share knowledge for mutual benefit. An impressive crowd of <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/open311-devcamp-tickets-434686158">developers, project managers, and policy makers</a> joined for a day of working groups. Explore what we covered on the <a href="http://wiki.open311.org/Open311DevCamp/">Open311 wiki</a>.
