A new group name for the home of GeoServer, OpenLayers and other open source geo tools. Vanessa wrote, <em>GeoServer has really taken off, and along the way, bolstering a larger community of production for open geo-based technologies. OpenPlans has become a leader in the field, contributing to related open source tools (including OpenLayers and GeoWebCache) and doing consulting work for clients like Google, Landgate, and Portland TriMet. And now the team that builds GeoServer and related products has a new home. </em>
