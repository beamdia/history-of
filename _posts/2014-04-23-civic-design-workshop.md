With Cyd Harrell from Code for America, we convened a day-long <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2014/05/user-testing-civic-design/">Civic Design workshop</a>, full of practical tips about talking with, understanding, and being guided by real users. Participants joined us from Philadelphia, Bridgeport, and NYC, representing various city departments including Information Technology and Telecommunications, Education, Housing, Housing Preservation & Development, Parks & Recreation, 311, and Mayorâ€™s Offices. Many paper giraffes were made.
