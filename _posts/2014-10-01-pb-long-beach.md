Participatory Budgeting comes to Long Beach, CA, Cambridge, MA, and returns to NYC. In each city, the Shareabouts map strengthens robust in-person actvitity - collecting ideas for projects, and making them visible to neighbors and city staff working on the process. With the <a href="http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/">Participatory Budgeting Project</a> and others working on PB, we go to a convening at the White House, and share some ideas for tech tools in our <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2014/05/supporting-participatory-budgeting-with-shareabouts/">Participatory Budgeting tools roadmap</a>. The NYC season of PB is a big expansion, inviting residents to get involved in spending $1m in 25 districts city-wide.
