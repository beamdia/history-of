It all begins with [GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/ "GeoServer"), an open source project for sharing geospatial data. Reflecting in 2010 on years of development, Vanessa wrote:

*When they started GeoServer, Mark Gorton, Chris Holmes, and their collaborators saw the huge potential for open source, collaborative technologies to help transportation-planning bodies make better decisions.*

*We realized early on that in order to do complicated transportation modeling right, first you need to know 'where the roads are'. This discrete technical problem shed light on a huge opportunity: every municipality in the world needs to manage and share location-based information, whether it’s with colleagues, parallel agencies, or private citizens. But the technology tools to meet this basic need were inadequate.*

*Sharing location-based information – whether road data, crime statistics, or water quality readings – was expensive and cumbersome, partly due to proprietary tools that relied on closed formats.*
