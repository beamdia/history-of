Over the year, we partner with several projects that catalyze and value community involvement in planning issues. In [Memphis](https://www.ioby.org/campaign/memphis), we work with the amazing <a href="http://ioby.org">ioby</a> team to turn project ideas into citizen-led, neighbor-funded change. Lane County in Orgeon uses a Shareabouts map to capture input from all road users, for a county transportation plan. In the Chicago suburbs, a website and map help residents identify the issues they care about for the Lake Corridor plan. In northeastern Illinois, bikers share feedback with CMAP about trail gaps. Closer to home for us, Phila2035 gathers hundreds of comments pinned to maps in two study areas.
