Working with the World Bank, we develop a real-time traffic app for Cebu City in the Phillipines. THe app collects real-time traffic data from 500 Android phones deployed in taxi cabs. On the go, data will provide citizens with up-to-date information about traffic conditions. Later, the historical archive will help inform planners and transport engineers.
