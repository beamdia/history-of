[David Moore](https://twitter.com/ppolitics) and team join us in the penthouse, working on [OpenCongress](https://www.opencongress.org/) and later on [AskThem.io](http://www.askthem.io/). David is a longstanding tenant, later joined by [Maryam Gunja](https://twitter.com/maryamgunja). 

[Noel Hidalgo](http://noneck.org/) joins us, working on Open NY Forum and the BikeNYC meetup. 

Also in the office during 2012, the hardworking [Reinvent Albany](http://reinventalbany.org/). And hardmapping [Vizzuality](http://www.vizzuality.com/), working on cool ecological mapping projects and early versions of [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com/).

We learn a lot from all of them. Thanks, officemates.
