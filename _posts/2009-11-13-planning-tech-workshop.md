The Open Planning Project and Regional Plan Association convened a couple of unconference-style workshops in late 2009. One of the activities was mapping out some common processes, to see how tech might plug in.

*Everyday social computing, mobile technology, and the adoption of "web 2.0" approaches by governments have laid the groundwork for far wider citizen involvement in civic life.  Citizens can now be involved earlier on, more frequently, and in more meaningful ways than was ever possible before.  How can these opportunities be leveraged for use in the city planning space?  What are the emerging technologies that will make this possible?  What are the bureaucratic, logistical, or social issues that need to be addressed in considering these ideas?  What tools could we build -- today -- that would be the most impactful?*
