New York City's community boards can request capital projects, but it's not a transparent process. Residents can't see what their neighbors might already be asking for, and the status of requests can often be a mystery. We set up a Shareabouts map for Brooklyn's CB6. In their own words - "Giving people an easy to use, online way to share their ideas, both with their neighbors and with the community board, will really help to open up and demystify the budget process.  This map will allow people to get their ideas out there, and hopefully this will make the budget process more transparent and more democratic."
