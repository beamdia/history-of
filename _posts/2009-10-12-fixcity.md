Started out as a project of the Brooklyn TA Volunteer committee.  http://nag-brooklyn.org/2009/10/want-more-bike-racks-try-fixcity/. Code is at https://github.com/openplans/fixcity.

"We are not attempting to write an application that fixes every planning issue in New York City. Rather, we are focusing on a specific planning issue, in a specific place to maximize integration between a governmental process and a particular community’s needs. We plan to expand this tool for use throughout the city (and hope it might prove useful for other planning issues too), but believe we’ll get better results by starting with the specific. The concept of submitting requests in a “project set,” for example, may be the single most helpful outcome of this project for the DOT, but is not emphasized in preceding projects like SeeClickFix and FixMyStreet."" -- lily
