"Started work on OpenBlock, in partnership with the Boston Globe and Columbia Tribune. With support from the Knight Foundation. This project kept Paul and Luke busy for several years, first turning the EveryBlock code into a documented project that others could deploy, and then working with the papers and other users on their own installs and configurations. Github

Here's the Columbia Tribune site - http://neighborhoods.columbiatribune.com/ and more about the collaboration from their team -- http://www.columbiatribune.com/news/local/tribune-launches-data-mapping-site-called-neighborhoods/article_5c6a1246-acc2-11e3-8eac-10604b9f6eda.html http://blog.openplans.org/2014/04/openblock-powers-neighborhood-news-for-the-columbia-daily-tribune/

The original EveryBlock code was made open source in June 2009. Building on the work of Adrian Holovaty and the Everyblock team, we worked to make OpenBlock-powered hyperlocal news easier to set up and manage. Our work on this project was supported by the Knight Foundation â€“ who also supported the initial creation of EveryBlock."
