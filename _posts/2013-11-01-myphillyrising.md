Philly rolls out MyPhillyRising, to support community involvement in turning around neighborhoods with chronic crime and quality of life issues. Already a well-established program making an impact in 19 neighborhoods, PhillyRising establishes long-term partnerships over quick fixes. The mobile website provides another tool in the toolbox, for easy listing of resources and events.
