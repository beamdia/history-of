NYCDOT invited New Yorkers to give input on locations for bike share. With a fun interface, some heavyweight promotion and tons of media coverage, the site is a hit. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>NYC Bike Share is on its way.

Clocking up over 10,000 suggestions and 65,000 support clicks, the site serves double duty of great data and valuable engagement. It gets thousands of New Yorkers engaged, creating positive engagement and buzz at a time when the idea of bikeshare wasn't universally accepted. The data helped the city, and as open data, it spawned various <a href="http://spatialityblog.com/2011/09/29/spatial-analysis-of-nyc-bikeshare-maps/">interesting analyses</a>, and even <a href="http://fuckyeahbikeshare.tumblr.com/page/5">an anonymous Tumblr blog</a> of the best contributions. NYCDOT describes all their outreach efforts and the role of the map in <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/bike-share-outreach-report.pdf">Designed by New Yorkers</a> (a good read if you're interested in best practices for city-wide engagement and tech tools).

<a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2011/12/hello-shareabouts/">Shareabouts as a configurable project</a> launches in November, built on Rails. Later, we rebuild with a Django architecture, and a loosely-coupled front and back end. We go on to replicate this type of Shareabouts map in other cities, helping planners collect input from tens of thousands of people.
