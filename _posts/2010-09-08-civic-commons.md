Our open gov became a standalone organization in 2010 as Civic Commons, spinning out with Nick, Phil, and Karl Fogel on board. Here's how Nick described the org at the time: 

*Civic Commons’ mission is to help governments share technology more effectively. Governments spend an enormous amount of time and effort producing and procuring technology, and while sharing investment and expertise is completely logical, many barriers stand in the way of this happening. Civic Commons will support the sharing of actual technology as well as the many related resources (such as policy language, contract language, case studies, etc.) needed to make this possible.*

Joined by Andrew McLaughlin, the Civic Commons team worked on an apps marketplace to help government tech purchasers make good tech choices, which Code for America absorbed into their capacity-building efforts for gov. Here's how <a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679077/the-civic-commons-marketplace-an-app-store-for-civic-tech">Fast Company saw the launch</a>: *The Marketplace is sort of like an app store and database for civic tech, where governments can search for software, compare alternatives, and share the technologies they’re already using. Grossman likens the Marketplace to a "CrunchBase for civic tech."*
