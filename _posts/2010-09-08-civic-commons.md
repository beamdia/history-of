"Civic Commonsâ€™ mission is to help governments share technology more effectively. Governments spend an enormous amount of time and effort producing and procuring technology, and while sharing investment and expertise is completely logical, many barriers stand in the way of this happening. Civic Commons will support the sharing of actual technology as well as the many related resources (such as policy language, contract language, case studies, etc.) needed to make this possible.

Joined by  Andrew McLaughlin. Later spins out with Nick, Phil and Karl on board, and is absorbed into CfA."
