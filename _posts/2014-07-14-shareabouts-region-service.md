2014 was a busy year for improvements to Shareabouts maps. Guided by requests from projects and user testing, we add and refine many features. A few highlights: <a href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts-region-service/commits/master">geographic lookups</a> for the Shareabouts data API, making it easy to attach useful data like Council District, neighborhood and city to locations; an embeddable, lightweight map; a Heroku button for easy deployments; a lot of new templates and icons; an editor hosted on Github pages, for managing map content; a dashboard for exploring and moderating; improved tools for getting data into and out of maps; and lots more. 

And because Shareabouts is open source, we see lots of projects using our code - like this <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2014/07/using-shareabouts-to-collect-ideas-for-transit-improvements/">transit improvements map by Crowdspot in Melbourne</a>.
