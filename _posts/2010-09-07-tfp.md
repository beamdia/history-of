Started work on NYC DOT Feedback Portals. Built on Wordpress, for DOT staff to easily set up new websites for projects. The beta site was a neighborhood transportation improvements project in Jackson Heights, Queens. Later bike share portals included a parking study in Manhattan's Chinatown, the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway, and later, the crowdsourcing map for bikeshare. Link to github.
