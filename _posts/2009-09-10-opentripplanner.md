OpenTripPlanner is an open source, multi-modal trip planner released under the LGPL. It's collaboratively developed by a team of developers from across the world and coordinated by OpenPlans and TriMet. It's free software, written in Java, and anyone is welcome to use and improve it.

Probably the most succesful open project from OpenPlans, in terms of the number of contributors -- OpenTripPlanner is an open source project and is a collaborative effort among many individuals, transit agencies, and non-profit organizations. Developers working on OpenTripPlanner hail from TriMet, OpenPlans, Graphserver, FivePoints, byCycle, and OneBusAway, among others. The working group page has a more complete listing of people who have contributed to the project. The official kickoff for the project was a transit workshop in Portland hosted by TriMet, the regional transportation authority.

Mention TriMet and other OTP examples. TriMet launches in November 2011.

July - [Open source multimodal routing workshop](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/kick-off-workshop) hosted by TriMet in Portland. [OpenTripPlanner](http://www.opentripplanner.org/) is born.
