Merran Swartwood spent a summer investigating how bus stops function as sites of information exchange, including spending some time along the B63 in Brooklyn -- "Is there a way to promote exploration along the bus's route that would benefit riders and nearby institutions and businesses? I'm in the midst of testing out a sort of Magic 8 Box that invites riders to peek inside to find out where the bus is."
