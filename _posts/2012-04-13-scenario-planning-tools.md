We contribute a chapter to <a href="http://www.lincolninst.edu/pubs/2027_Opening-Access-to-Scenario-Planning-Tools">a Lincoln Institute effort on scenario planning tools</a>. At the time, mostly desktop GIS-based software with limited open source. One report and four symposia later, there's a lot more going on, thanks to Lincoln's leadership and a dedicated <a href="http://placematters.org/blog/category/optg/">open planning tools group</a> (powered by many excellent advances in web and open mapping more generally).
