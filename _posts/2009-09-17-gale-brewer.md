nytransitdata.org, making the case to open up NY's transit data with a website and advocacy, building on the event in Aug.

CM Gale Brewer leads the call, "Opening transit data would require almost no capital investment by the MTA, while the application developers would return innovative tools of immense everyday value to the public at minimal expense."
 
Gale continues to be a huge supporter of open data, passing the open data law in 2011.
