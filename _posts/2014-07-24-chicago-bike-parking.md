Need a bike rack? If you're a Chicago resident, you can use a friendly map to request and check status of requests. We built a Shareabouts map for Chicago with an editor interface for the project team. As requests come in, they can easily mark them as pending, approved or rejected (for example, insufficient sidewalk space). Everyone can see and comment on requests, and even upload pics showing the potential location. A similar map helps with reporting abandoned bikes. Altogether, a lot of transparency wrapped up in an easy map that works nicely on all devices.

This project was a great example of our <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2014/07/the-openplans-way/">open source approach</a>: CDOT's ideas for the bike parking map nicely overlapped with some new features we already wanted to add to Shareabouts – address lookups, so you can search for an address to zoom the map; and geocoding, to automatically tag new places with their ward, neighborhood, or district. We included these features in our scope of work, and built them for Chicago’s needs. But we built them into the core Shareabouts project first, so everyone else benefits too.
