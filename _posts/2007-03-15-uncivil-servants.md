Tired of government employees parking illegally in your neighborhoood?**

So are a lot of other New Yorkers.

That's why we are building this web site. Go out and take photos of parking permit abuse in your neighborhood. Together, we will push New York City government to solve this problem.

The site clocked 10,000 page views weekely, and by the end of 2011, over 1,300 photos of violations and 7,463 comments were posted.

The site was controversial, because photos of (illegally parked) law enforement vehicles showed their license places. Here's some coverage of the debate, [NYTimes: Debate Over a Web Site About Parking](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/nyregion/22parking.html?_r=0).

Pinning photos and comments on a map returned in various forms later - blockpartynyc, fixcity, and Shareabouts.
