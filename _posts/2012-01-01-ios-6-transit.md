iOS 6 is released without transit support. OpenPlans leads the charge to develop an open transit app for iOS 6, with a hugely successful crowdfunding campaign. Intern Matt Conway builds a public dashboard to show where open transit data is available in North America. In the end, OpenPlans doesn't build the app, but there is a groundswell of support for open transit data.
