Before there was Tumblr, we worked with the Orton Family Foundation on a web application that allowed visitors to post stories and other media about their communities. Including video, audio and pic embedding, with a map to find and explore stories. "Community Almanac is a fun way to tell your neighbors about your favorite sledding hill or swimming hole, the best tree to climb or the coolest place  to play stickball. It's a lasting record of the place you love — the place you call home." Still running today at <a href="http://www.communityalmanac.org/">communityalmanac.org</a>.

Andy <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2009/08/community-almanac-redesign-2/">blogged in detail</a> about the design process: *The charm of this layout resides in its flexible width. Although it behaves as a fixed-width layout, it’s not. In larger windows the sidebar items float beside each other, forming columns across the left-hand page. If your monitor is ridiculously large you can even see the whole book! This fluid layout inspired quite a few bells and whistles, not to mention a couple of fun Easter eggs.*
