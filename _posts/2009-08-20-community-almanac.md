built for the Orton Family Foundation. Pre-dated Tumblr etc. Some nice easter eggs. 
A web application that allows visitors to post stories and other media about their communities via an interactive web map. Community Almanac is a fun way to tell your neighbors about your favorite sledding hill or swimming hole, the best tree to climb or the coolest place  to play stickball. It's a lasting record of the place you loveâ€”the place you call home. http://www.communityalmanac.org/ http://blog.openplans.org/2009/08/community-almanac-redesign-2/"
