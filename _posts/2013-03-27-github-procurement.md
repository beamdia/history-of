Philly invites innovative proposals for a community engagement app, so we craft a response that's entirely open, fully responsive and presented using Github pages -- <a href="http://openplans.github.io/phillyrising-proposal/">openplans.github.io/phillyrising-proposal</a>. This was a really fun proposal to write, and a big contrast to some other city procurement processes we went through. <a href="http://civic.io/2013/03/27/experiments-in-github-based-procurement/">Here's Mark Headd's take on it</a>.

The big city procurements were hard, because there was a large paperwork burden up front. These projects also came with complex invoicing requirements, and slow payments. Although this Github-based proposal was fun, it didn't catch on. Most smaller projects in 2013 and 2014 were finalized with a standard Word doc of terms, and an engagement letter template, also in Word. Not as cool, but flexible enough that we could turn around a response soon after getting off the phone with a potential client.
