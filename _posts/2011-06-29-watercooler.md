IRC was the chat tool of choice at OpenPlans, but we also kept a lively backchannel on our "watercooler" list. Thanks to Anthony's ocassional blogging about it, we'll always know that <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2011/07/from-the-watercooler-2/">July's discusssions included</a>:

 * Patents and the patent trolls who abuse them. 
 * Whether San Franciscoans might start taking mass transit if BMW designs the train interiors? 
 * Text messaging on the B63 vs teenagers (700 per day!)
 * The historical what-ifs of removing bridge tolls on the Williamsburg Bridge
 * Developments in alt-people moving: slides; skates; channels; poles
 * Real-time APIs from Google Traffic and Uber
 * Neighborhood discussion lists
 * Inter-state communication
 * Redistricting Massachusetts
 * Videos of every NYC block
 * Running data 
 * and some commentary on a new water tower taking shape outside
