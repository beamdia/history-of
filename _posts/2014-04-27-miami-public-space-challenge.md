Got an idea for improving public space in Miami? Better parks, community chalkboards, fitness equipment, murals...? For a second year, we helped the Miami Foundation and partners gather ideas from residents, including pictures and comments. Judges used the site to vote on the top ideas, and the map was kept up to date with info about the shortlist and winning projects. Integration with <a href="http://ioby.org">ioby</a> meant that funding progress was shown right here on the map.

We added some great features to the open source core of Shareabouts for this project - a list view of ideas, filtering and sorting, follow-up emails, and the voting tools.
