TOPP worked on a community organizing tool known variously as OpenCore, OpenPlans, and eventually Coactivate (which is <a href="http://coactivate.org/">still going</a>). The goal was to provide a set of tools that would enable local collaboration and organizing around all sorts of issues, not just safer streets. 

The OpenPlans organizing plaform never caught on, and despite lots of similar projects, it's still an elusive idea that gets lots of civic tech attention.  Community organizing challenges are complex, and trying to come up with a toolkit that is both flexible and decently functional is hard. 

Here's what we wrote at the time: "OpenPlans is a free, hosted, and integrated suite of web-based tools intended to give active citizens the resources they need to organize virtually to effect real world change.   OpenPlans hopes to decrease the barriers to entry for community members as they collaborate to improve their society.  As an easy-to-use integrated on-line environment, OpenPlans offers proven, useful tools -- web space, wikis, email lists, forums, etc. -- free of charge and free of advertising.  Uniting mature open source solutions, improving existing projects, and developing new technologies, OpenPlans will evolve to meet the needs of its users."
