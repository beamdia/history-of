<p>After using Shareabouts in 2012 to collect ideas for Maconâ€™s College Hill neighborhood, we partner again with <a href="http://interface-studio.com">Interface Studio</a> to support the Macon Action Plan. Using Plan in a Box, we set up a project website providing essential info about meetings and events, plus useful background to the project. Also with Interface, we help planning for downtown Grand Rapids and the Grand River, as part of the GRForward project. </p>
