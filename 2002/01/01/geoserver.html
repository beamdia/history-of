<p>It all begins with <a href="http://geoserver.org/" title="GeoServer">GeoServer</a>, an open source project for sharing geospatial data. Reflecting in 2010 on years of development, Vanessa wrote:</p>

<p><em>When they started GeoServer, Mark Gorton, Chris Holmes, and their collaborators saw the huge potential for open source, collaborative technologies to help transportation-planning bodies make better decisions.</em></p>

<p><em>We realized early on that in order to do complicated transportation modeling right, first you need to know ‘where the roads are’. This discrete technical problem shed light on a huge opportunity: every municipality in the world needs to manage and share location-based information, whether it’s with colleagues, parallel agencies, or private citizens. But the technology tools to meet this basic need were inadequate.</em></p>

<p><em>Sharing location-based information – whether road data, crime statistics, or water quality readings – was expensive and cumbersome, partly due to proprietary tools that relied on closed formats.</em></p>
