<p>An evergreen challenge at OpenPlans was keeping everyone informed about projects. The team was distributed geographically, but also spread widely in working hours, and by topic – bus tracking, trip planning, transit data advocacy and bike share crowdsourcing all co-existing. No problem with chat and staying in touch: IRC was the mainstay until we switched over to Slack in 2014. And a plethora of mailing lists. Actual project management happened via Trac, Basecamp, and for the final couple of years, Pivotal Tracker. But we needed something for the in-between level - not at the detail of individual development stories, and more detailed than occassional chats at staff meetings.</p>

<p>Nick created The Board in mid-2008, inspired by his teenage experiences with <a href="http://www.nickgrossman.is/2009/06/21/introducing-the-board/">ballboy management at the US Open</a>. Despite this pedigree, The Board fell out of use. Another approach was a weekly priorities email, listing tasks for the week ahead. On Fridays, you’d send a follow-up to identify what actually happened. Useful, but easy to drop off. </p>

<p>Jeff and Andy brought back the board concept with MissionCTRL in 2012, with a listing of everyone on the team and multiple project tags next to our names. If you let your listing get stale, little sad faces appeared. The digital version superceeded a whiteboard in the office, which was tricky for remote staff to update.</p>
