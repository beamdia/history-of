<p>Naama Lissar joins as a summer fellow, and stays for most of 2012 too, working on a directory of tech tools for community boards. “How can technology empower Community Boards? The foundation for meaningful public participation exists, but the potential remains unrealized. We think new tools can complement and strengthen existing methods. Simple tech tools can maximize citizen engagement by improving Community Boards’ visibility, communication, outreach, data collection, and more.” Explore the directory (now community-run) at <a href="http://communityboardtools.org">communityboardtools.org</a></p>
