<p><em>Let’s face it: the internet is a big place. It can be tough to hunt down the articles that are truly worth your attention among the zillions of things piling up and waiting to be read.</em></p>

<p><em>We’re building Melkjug to help solve this problem. Tell Melkjug what you commonly read and use Melkjug’s unique interface to tune in what you care about the most. That way, you can spend more time reading what interests you and less time finding it.</em></p>

<p>Luke and Josh worked on Melkjug, a newsfeed reader that responded to your preferences. Unlike other news readers at the time, which just showed a long list of unread articlesm Melkjug could be ‘tuned’ to show you more of what you like. Today, that’s a given, but it was cool in 2007. Some parts live on in Radar, a python and Couch feed aggregator.</p>
