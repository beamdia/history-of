<h2>Planning Tech workshop</h2>
<p>Planning Tech workshop at 148 Lafayette Street. A prototype for TransportationCamp and later, PlanningCamp.</p>

<p>Everyday social computing, mobile technology, and the adoption of “web 2.0” approaches by governments have laid the groundwork for far wider citizen involvement in civic life.  Citizens can now be involved earlier on, more frequently, and in more meaningful ways than was ever possible before.  How can these opportunities be leveraged for use in the city planning space?  What are the emerging technologies that will make this possible?  What are the bureaucratic, logistical, or social issues that need to be addressed in considering these ideas?  What tools could we build – today – that would be the most impactful?   </p>

<p>The Open Planning Project is interested in developing free, open source tools to support citizen engagement in planning.  To that end, we are reaching out to the planning, government, nonprofit, citizen and tech communities to help us explore opportunities and share ideas.  This event should be the first of many, and will be a hands-on workshop aiming to bring together many diverse perspectives.</p>

<p>The workshop will follow the “unconference,” or “BarCamp,” format, where sessions and talks are proposed and led by the participants of the workshop.</p>
