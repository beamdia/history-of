<h2>&rsquo;They call themselves The Open Planning Project&rsquo;</h2>
<p>Early in 2009, <a href="http://www.planetizen.com/node/37154">Mike Lydon writes about TOPP and our advocacy journalism stable-mates</a>: “At the center of the city’s livable streets movement is a little known non-profit comprised of Gen X and Y tech geeks, educators, artists, and journalist-urban activists who leverage open web technology to network catalytic change in the 21st century city.” Mike later snags a desk from us in the penthouse, which shows that you can’t go wrong writing flattering articles.</p>

<p>The OpenPlans of this era was a sprawling team of enthusiastic, young innovators finding their feet as makers of change as much as building software. This wasn’t an era that produced projects used by lots of cities, or much revenue. But this team started conversations and explored ideas that they continue today with many different organizations.</p>
