<h2>Sandy and the aftermath</h2>
<p>In October, Sandy hits NYC hard, devastating low-lying neighborhoods. 44 people die. Power is out below 14th St for several days.</p>

<p>In the aftermath, the MTA closes tunnels because of flooding. We use new features in OpenTripPlanner Analyst to <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2012/10/visualizing-transit-accessibility-minute-by-minute/">show the difference in transit accessibility</a> before and after the storm. </p>

<p>Later, we work with NY Rising in six neighborhoods, providing collaborative maps for residents to “fact-check” basemaps used for planning future responses. Is the map missing a day care facility or a building with seniors? No problem - add it to the map.</p>
