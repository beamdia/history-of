<p>2012 was a great year for the organization. The small Civic Works team entered a two-year sprint of building open tools that got used and re-used (something that remains elusive in the civic and planning tech worlds). Our Transportation team wrapped up Bus Time, and Conveyal became a separate company working on OpenTripPlanner.</p>

<p>“I am really impressed by and proud of the work that OpenPlans has been doing lately.  They are on fire pumping out small, but beautiful, compelling and powerful apps.”</p>
