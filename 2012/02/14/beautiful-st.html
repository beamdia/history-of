<h2>Beautiful Streets launches on Valentines Day</h2>
<blockquote>Most of us can label a building or a street as such when we walk by it, but we’d probably struggle to explain exactly what makes it so. Maybe it's the landscaping, or the sight lines, or the architectural style? The tech-savvy folks at OpenPlans.org have been pondering this exact same question. And – as is their style – they’re refusing to take "no data" for an answer.</blockquote>

<p>On Valentines Day, <a href="http://blog.openplans.org/2012/02/beautiful_streets/">we launch a “hot or not” for streets</a>. Using Google Street View to compare pairs of streets in Philly, over 100,000 comparisons are submitted. The app is later re-used by our friends at PlaceMatters in Denver, and we return to Street View again for a couple of NYC projects.  </p>
