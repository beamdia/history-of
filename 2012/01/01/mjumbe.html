<p>Mjumbe Poe joins fresh from his year as an inagurual Code for America fellow. Based in Philly, he pairs with Aaron on Shareabouts and Plan In A Box, while keeping <a href="http://www.councilmatic.org/">Councilmatic</a> running back home. Not his first contact with the organization - before their OpenPlans days, Mjumbe and Frank met at a civic engagemement event in our penthouse in 2010. </p>

<p>Continuing as the lead developer on <a href="https://github.com/openplans/shareabouts">Shareabouts</a>, Mjumbe now works with planners and cities to provide community engagement tech at <a href="http://about.mjumbepoe.com/">Poe Public</a>.</p>
