<p>iOS 6 is released without transit support. OpenPlans leads the charge to develop an open transit app for iOS 6, with a hugely successful crowdfunding campaign. Intern Matt Conway builds a public dashboard to show where open transit data is available in North America. In the end, OpenPlans doesn’t build the app, but there is a groundswell of support for open transit data.</p>

<p>iOS6, no transit. Kickstarter, successful, but we can’t sustain the team to work on it. http://blog.openplans.org/2012/07/opentripplanner-mobile-app-for-iphone-kickstarter-campaign-some-of-your-questions-answered/</p>
